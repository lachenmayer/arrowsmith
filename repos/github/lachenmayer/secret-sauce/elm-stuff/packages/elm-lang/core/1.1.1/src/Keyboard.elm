{-| Library for working with keyboard input.

# Representing Keys
@docs KeyCode

# Directions
@docs arrows, wasd, directions

# Specific Keys
The following signals are `True` when the particular key is pressed and `False`
otherwise.

@docs enter, space, ctrl, shift, alt, meta

# General Keypresses
@docs isDown, keysDown, lastPressed

{-| Type alias to make it clearer what integers are supposed to represent
in this library. Use `Char.toCode` and `Char.fromCode` to convert key codes
to characters. Use the uppercase character with `toCode`.

{-| Custom key directions to support different locales. The order is up, down,
left, right.

{-| A signal of records indicating which arrow keys are pressed.

  * `{ x = 0, y = 0 }` when pressing no arrows.
  * `{ x =-1, y = 0 }` when pressing the left arrow.
  * `{ x = 1, y = 1 }` when pressing the up and right arrows.
  * `{ x = 0, y =-1 }` when pressing the down, left, and right arrows.
