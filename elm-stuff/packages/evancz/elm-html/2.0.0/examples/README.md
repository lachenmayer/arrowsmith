# Examples

There are a bunch of examples here, and [the TodoMVC example][todo] is a great
example of a more complicated app with more robust architecture.

### Run an Example

Let's say you want to see the results of `Yogi.elm`. You would run the
following two commands:

```bash
elm-package install
elm-reactor
```

Then open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/Yogi.elm` in your browser!

You only need to run `elm-package install` once. That will grab the latest
released version of the `elm-html` library.
